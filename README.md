# Covid_Analysis_Tableau

This project uses Tableau and COVID-19 data from Gov.uk to investigate the impact and severity of COVID in the UK, while considering the effectiveness of vaccines during the pandemic.

The attached ppt in the repository displays the research objectives, presentation of results, analyses, limitations & future recommendations.

Note: The raw data and Tableau file where the storyboard and visualisations are made can also be accessed.
